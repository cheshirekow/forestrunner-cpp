                <Property Name="Text">This game was created to research human reactions to high velocity motion through a complex environment (such as a forest).  It was designed with the Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The game records the final time and settings for each run to a central server, but no personal information is recorded, and no link between the player and the data collected exists - participation is completely anonymous.

Participation is VOLUNTARY.  Subjects may decline to answer any or all questions at any time.  Subjects may decline further participation, at any time, without adverse consequences.  Confidentiality and/or anonymity are assured.

You must agree to these terms to play to the game.
